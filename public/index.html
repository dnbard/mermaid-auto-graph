## Graph
This statement declares a new graph and the direction of the graph layout.

```
graph TD
```

This declares a graph oriented from top to bottom.

![Example 3](http://www.sveido.com/mermaid/img/ex3.png)

```
graph LR
```

This declares a graph oriented from left to right.

Possible directions are:

* TB - top bottom
* BT - bottom top
* RL - right left
* LR - left right
* TD - same as TB

## Nodes

### A node (default)
```
id1;
```

![Single node](http://www.sveido.com/mermaid/img/ex5.png)

Note that the id is what is displayed in the box.

### A node with text
It is also possible to set text in the box that differs from the id. If this is done several times, it is the last text
found for the node that will be used. Also if you define edges for the node later on, you can omit text definitions. The
one previously defined will be used when rendering the box.

```
id1[This is the text in the box];
```

### A node with round edges
```
id1(This is the text in the box);
```

### A node in the form of a circle
```
id1((This is the text in the box));
```

### A node in an asymetric shape
```
id1>This is the text in the box];
```

### A node (rhombus)
```
id1{This is the text in the box};
```

### Styling a node
It is possible to apply specific styles such as a thicker border or a different background color to a node.

```
graph LR;
    id1(Start)-->id2(Stop);
    style id1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
    style id2 fill:#ccf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5;
```

#### Classes
More convenient then defining the style everytime is to define a class of styles and attach this class to the nodes that
should have a different look.

a class definition looks like the example below:

```
    classDef className fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
```

Attachment of a  class to a node is done as per below:

```
    class nodeId1 className;
```

It is also possible to attach a class to a list of nodes in one statement:

```
    class nodeId1,nodeId2 className;
```

#### Default class

If a class is named default it will be assigned to all classes without specific class definitions.

```
    classDef default fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
```


## Links between nodes

Nodes can be connected with links/edges. It is possible to have different types of links or attach a text string to a link.

### A link with arrow head
```
A-->B;
```

![Link with arrowhead](http://www.sveido.com/mermaid/img/ex4.png)

### An open link

```
A---B;
```

![Open link](http://www.sveido.com/mermaid/img/ex10.png)

### Text on links

```
A---|This is the text|B;
```

![Text on links](http://www.sveido.com/mermaid/img/ex11.png)

### Styling links
It is possible to style links for instance a link that is going back in the flow. This is done by the linkStyle statement as in the example below:

```
linkStyle 3 stroke:#ff3,stroke-width:4px;
```</div>
        </div>
